# Description

Linear Stock Price Predictor is a low-code implementation of multiple machine learning models to predict the "Close" value of linear stocks, given the "Open".
Currently, it has only been tested with IRFC shares.

## TODO
+ Make it low code.
+ Add more ML models.
+ Add a way to connect the data. It is currently hardcoded for IRFC, fix it.
+ Do the data preprocessing.
+ Try to automate the process of getting the data.   

## AIMS

1. Make it usable by everybody, even non-developers
2. Add more models, and hopefully make it work for more than just linear stocks.
